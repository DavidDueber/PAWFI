# PAWFI
People are Wierd

Run the contents of PAWFI to load the PAWFI function into your R environment. Then, the individual simulations from PAWFI Simulations can be run. Examples 3B and 3D are expected to take several days, but the rest can be done in under 24 hours each.

For reasons I do not understand, Anonymous GitHub does not render PAWFI correctly. I made a version (PAWFI2) that you can copy/paste into RStudio and run
